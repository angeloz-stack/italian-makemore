# italian-makemore
Makemore by Andrey Karpathy trained on italian names. <br />
<br />
from the originale makemore README:<br />
*makemore takes one text file as input, where each line is assumed to be one training thing, and generates more things like it. Under the hood, it is an autoregressive character-level language model, with a wide choice of models from bigrams all the way to a Transformer (exactly as seen in GPT).* <br />
