# italian-makemore
Makemore by Andrey Karpathy trained on italian names. For educational purposes I rebuilt everything from scratch, that's why this is not a fork of the original repository. <br />
<br />
Rrom the originale makemore README:<br />
*makemore takes one text file as input, where each line is assumed to be one training thing, and generates more things like it. Under the hood, it is an autoregressive character-level language model, with a wide choice of models from bigrams all the way to a Transformer (exactly as seen in GPT).* <br />
